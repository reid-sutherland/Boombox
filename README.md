# Boombox

This plugin offers a Radio-based CustomItem (The JBL Speaker a.k.a. "Boombox") that plays music or other audio for players within proximity to enjoy.

## In-game usage

**IMPORTANT:** Be sure to bind the server-specific Boombox keys to use it properly.

The Boombox appears to be a larger-than-usual guard radio. By default it spawns in the SCP-914 room, but this can be changed via config. 

Uses:
- Use the Boombox like you would any normal radio.
- Turning it ON should begin to play the first song in the first playlist. Turning it OFF will pause the playback. 
- Change the radio frequency/range to change playlists, the config has a different playlist option for each range. 
- Press the Change Song key to cycle to the next song in the current playlist. 
- Press the Shuffle Song key to switch to a random song in the entire set of playlists/songs.
- Press the Loop Song key to toggle looping of the currently playing song.

## Installation / Depedencies

Main dependencies:
- [EXILED](https://github.com/ExMod-Team/EXILED)
- [AudioPlayerApi](https://github.com/Killers0992/AudioPlayerApi) (also requires NVorbis.dll)

This plugin uses Exiled so .dlls must be installed in the normal locations. Unless your server uses non-standard paths, assume that `%EXILED%` refers to the path where Exiled is normally installed: `C:\Users\%UserName%\AppData\Roaming\EXILED`.
1. Download the files from the latest release
1. Place `Boombox.dll` in `%EXILED%\Plugins\`
1. Unzip `dependencies.zip` and place all .dlls in `%EXILED%\Plugins\dependencies`

## Configuration

The `.yml` config file will be generated in the standard location if it does not exist yet: `%EXILED%\Configs\Plugins\Boombox\<server-port>.yml`.

Most of the config properties are fairly self-explanatory and have descriptions. The easter egg is an exception, I would not recommend it by default but if you're curiuos you'll just have to try it. :)

However, the Boombox really does not do very much unless you add some audio files to the config and the audio-file location.

### Adding audio files

This plugin uses AudioPlayerApi for playing music, so the standard requirements for that library apply here as well. Specific requirements:
1. Format: `.ogg`
1. Channels: 1 (Mono)
1. Frequency: 48kHz (48,000 Hz)
See [AudioPlayerApi](https://github.com/Killers0992/AudioPlayerApi) for extra details and a recommended converter.

Place your .ogg files in this directory: `%EXILED%\Audio\Boombox`. You may have to create the directory first. I am planning on making the path configurable soon as well.

Then, in the config, just reference them by their filename. For example:
```yml
boombox:
  # other boombox fields...

  playlists:
    Short:
      name: 'Playlist #1'
      songs:
      - 'example_song.ogg'
      - 'example_song_2.ogg'
    # other playlists...
```

## Other notes

#### Limitations and issues

1. Standard limitations of playing audio via AudioPlayerApi
1. Like other plugins that use AudioPlayerApi, this plugin may cause conflicts with certain other plugins related to radio and/or voice communication patching
  - e.g. ChaosRadio, ScpProximity, etc.
1. Boomboxes on the ground (as Pickups) will play transmitted Radio messages like a normal radio
  - I plan on fixing this via Harmony patching in the future, however this will likely cause further conflicts with plugins mentioned above
